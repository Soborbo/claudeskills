# Phase 1: SEO & Intent

## Information Gain (Critical)

Google's algorithm measures how much NEW information you provide beyond existing results. Content that rephrases SERP consensus scores near-zero and gets penalized.

### Gap Analysis Process

1. **Search** top 3 results for your target query
2. **Extract Consensus** — List what ALL results say
3. **Find the Gap** — What's missing? This is your angle.

### Your Content Must Include ONE Of:

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| Original data | "Our analysis of 500 projects shows..." |
| Case study | "When we worked with [Client]..." |
| Contrarian insight | "Contrary to popular belief..." |
| Unique framework | "The 3-Step Method we developed..." |
| Expert quote | Named industry expert |

### Forbidden (Zero Information Gain)

- Rephrasing what top results already say
- Generic advice without specific data
- "Everybody knows" content
- Lists identical to competitors

---

## Entity Salience

Modern SEO ranks "Entity Salience" — how clearly the algorithm identifies what your document is ABOUT.

### Entity as Subject Rule

The main entity must be the grammatical SUBJECT, not just mentioned.

❌ "Many developers use Python for speed"
✅ "Python's speed attracts developers"

### First Sentence Rule

Every H2's first sentence: main entity in subject position.

```markdown
## How Much Does [Service] Cost?

[Service] typically costs £X-£Y... ← "[Service]" is subject
```

### Entity Density

- First 100 words: main entity as subject
- Each H2: section entity in first sentence
- Throughout: related entities mentioned naturally

---

## Headline Formulas (Neil Patel Strategy)

Headlines determine click-through rate from search results and social shares. Neil Patel's research shows headlines with numbers and specific formulas generate significantly more engagement.

### Number-Based Formulas (Highest Performing)

**Odd numbers** perform better than even numbers (brain perceives them as more believable).

✅ **Winning formulas:**
- "7 Ways to [Achieve Outcome] in [Timeframe]"
- "11 [Topic] Tips That Actually Work in 2026"
- "5 [Topic] Mistakes Costing You £X Every Year"
- "13 [Topic] Secrets [Authority Figure] Won't Tell You"
- "9 Proven [Topic] Strategies for [Specific Result]"

**Examples:**
```
✅ 7 Solar Panel Cost Factors You're Probably Ignoring
✅ 11 Hidden Moving Costs That Destroy Your Budget
✅ 5 Roofing Mistakes Costing UK Homeowners £2,000+ Annually
```

### How-To Formulas

How-to guides consistently perform well because they promise practical value.

✅ **Effective patterns:**
- "How to [Achieve Goal] Without [Common Problem]"
- "How to [Achieve Goal] Even If [Limiting Belief]"
- "How to [Achieve Goal] in [Timeframe]"
- "How [Authority] [Achieved Result]" (case study angle)

**Examples:**
```
✅ How to Get Accurate Moving Quotes Without Booking 10 Surveys
✅ How to Choose Solar Panels Even If You Know Nothing About Electricity
✅ How to Renovate Your Kitchen in 3 Weeks
✅ How This London Family Saved £1,200 on Installation Costs
```

### Power Words (Emotional Triggers)

Incorporate power words that trigger curiosity, urgency, or authority:

**Curiosity:** Secret, Hidden, Untold, Surprising, Shocking, Little-Known
**Urgency:** Now, Today, Fast, Quick, Immediate, Instant
**Authority:** Proven, Expert, Professional, Complete, Ultimate, Definitive
**Value:** Free, Save, Avoid, Prevent, Protect, Guarantee
**Specificity:** Exact, Step-by-Step, Complete, Comprehensive

**Good combinations:**
```
✅ The Complete Guide to [Topic]: Everything You Need to Know in 2026
✅ 7 Proven Ways to Save £X on [Service] (Expert Analysis)
✅ The Hidden Costs of [Topic] Nobody Tells You About
✅ Instant [Result]: How to [Achieve Goal] in [Short Timeframe]
```

### Question-Based Headlines

Questions create engagement by triggering the reader's need for answers.

✅ **Effective patterns:**
- "Is [Topic] Worth It in 2026?" (cost-benefit analysis)
- "What's the Real Cost of [Topic]?" (pricing transparency)
- "Which [Option A] vs [Option B] Is Right for You?" (comparison)
- "How Much Does [Service] Actually Cost?" (informational)

**Examples:**
```
✅ Is Solar Worth It in 2026? (Real ROI Data from 500+ Installs)
✅ What's the Real Cost of Moving House in London?
✅ Which Solar Panels Last Longest? Monocrystalline vs Polycrystalline Tested
```

### Title Tag Optimization

**Character limits:**
- **50-60 characters** optimal (Google's display limit)
- Front-load primary keyword (first 3-5 words)
- Include year for dated content (2026)
- Include location for local services (London, UK, etc.)

**Power formula:**
```
[Number] [Power Word] [Topic] [Benefit] ([Qualifier] [Year])
```

**Examples:**
```
✅ 7 Hidden Solar Costs Destroying Your Budget (UK 2026) — 54 chars
✅ Moving House Cost Guide: Save £X (London 2026) — 46 chars
✅ 11 Roof Repair Mistakes Costing You £2K+ (2026) — 48 chars
```

### A/B Testing Headlines

Use headline analyzer tools to score your titles:
- **CoSchedule Headline Analyzer** - scores word balance, length, sentiment
- **Sharethrough Headline Analyzer** - engagement and quality scores
- **Advanced Marketing Institute (AMI)** - emotional marketing value

**Target scores:**
- Overall headline score: >70/100
- Emotional Marketing Value (EMV): >30%
- Word balance: Mix of common, uncommon, emotional, power words

### Title Checklist

- [ ] Contains odd number (3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13) OR clear how-to/question
- [ ] 50-60 characters (not cut off in SERPs)
- [ ] Primary keyword in first 5 words
- [ ] At least one power word (proven, secret, complete, hidden, etc.)
- [ ] Year included for dated content (2026)
- [ ] Location included for local services (London, UK, etc.)
- [ ] Specific benefit/outcome clear
- [ ] No clickbait (title accurately reflects content)

---

## Search Intent Types

Every article declares ONE dominant intent. CTA must match.

| Intent | User Goal | Content Type | CTA Match |
|--------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| **informational** | Learn | How-to, Guide | Newsletter, Download |
| **commercial** | Research before buying | Cost guide | Calculator, Quote |
| **comparison** | Evaluate options | X vs Y | Consultation |
| **transactional** | Ready to act | Service page | Contact, Book |

### Intent Rules

- `informational`: NO aggressive sales CTAs
- `commercial`: MUST link to calculator/quote
- `comparison`: MUST have clear recommendation
- `transactional`: MUST have direct action path

---

## Internal Linking

### Hard Rules by Content Type

| Content Type | Word Count | Internal Links | First Link |
|--------------|------------|----------------|------------|
| Quick guide | 500-800 | 2-3 | Within 100 words |
| Standard | 1000-1500 | 3-4 | Within 100 words |
| **Pillar** | 2500+ | **8-12** | Within 100 words |

### Pillar Article Link Strategy

For 2500+ word pillar content, distribute links throughout:

```
Intro (0-300 words):      2 links (calculator + related pillar)
Section 1 (300-800):      2 links (cluster articles)
Section 2 (800-1500):     2-3 links (service pages + clusters)
Section 3 (1500-2200):    2-3 links (clusters + tools)
Conclusion (2200+):       1-2 links (CTA + next steps)
```

### Link Relevance Rules

- Every link must be contextually relevant to the sentence
- No link stuffing — max 1 link per 200 words
- Vary anchor text — don't repeat same anchor
- Mix link types: clusters, pillars, service pages, tools

### Good Anchors
- "solar panel installation costs London"
- "our instant quote calculator"
- "complete guide to choosing a provider"

### Bad Anchors
- "click here"
- "read more"
- "this article"

---

## Elite External Link Strategy (2025)

External links are not noise — they're structural elements that build your page's authority through Knowledge Graph connections and Information Gain signals.

### Link Type Classification & `rel` Attribute Matrix

Every outbound link must be categorized by type. This determines the signals sent to search engines.

| Type | Description | nofollow | noopener | SEO/E-E-A-T Value |
|------|-------------|----------|----------|-------------------|
| `citation` | Data, statistics, research | ❌ No | ✔ Yes | High (credibility) |
| `authority` | Professional body, government | ❌ No | ✔ Yes | Excellent (trust) |
| `reputation` | Author/company verification (LinkedIn) | ❌ No | ✔ Yes | Required (E-E-A-T) |
| `commercial` | Partner or unpaid service mention | ⚠ Context | ✔ Yes | Context-dependent |
| `affiliate` | Commission link | ✔ Yes + `sponsored` | ✔ Yes | Required disclosure |
| `ugc` | User-generated content | ✔ Yes + `ugc` | ✔ Yes | Required disclosure |

**Note:** `noopener` is required for ALL `target="_blank"` links for security.

### Implementation by Type

```html
<!-- Citation (research, data) -->
<a href="https://ons.gov.uk/..." 
   target="_blank" 
   rel="noopener noreferrer"
   data-link-type="citation">
   ONS household spending data
</a>

<!-- Authority (government, professional body) -->
<a href="https://gov.uk/..." 
   target="_blank" 
   rel="noopener noreferrer"
   data-link-type="authority">
   official government guidelines
</a>

<!-- Reputation (author verification) -->
<a href="https://linkedin.com/in/..." 
   target="_blank" 
   rel="noopener noreferrer"
   data-link-type="reputation">
   John Smith's professional profile
</a>

<!-- Affiliate/Sponsored -->
<a href="https://partner.com/..." 
   target="_blank" 
   rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored"
   data-link-type="affiliate">
   recommended product
</a>
```

### Approved Authority Domains

| Category | UK Sources | International |
|----------|------------|---------------|
| Government | gov.uk, nhs.uk, legislation.gov.uk | europa.eu |
| News | bbc.co.uk, theguardian.com, reuters.com, ft.com | nytimes.com |
| Consumer | which.co.uk, moneysavingexpert.com | - |
| Industry | Relevant trade association sites | - |
| Academic | .ac.uk domains, scholar.google.com | .edu domains |
| Statistics | ons.gov.uk, statista.com | worldbank.org |

### Anchor Text Policy (Critical)

The anchor text must precisely describe the target page's relevance. "Vacuum" links (generic anchors) can trigger penalties.

**Forbidden patterns:**
- "here", "source", "website", "click here"
- "according to a study" (without naming it)
- "link", "this page", "read more"

**Required pattern:** Anchor includes source name + the claim being supported.

| ❌ Bad | ✅ Good |
|--------|---------|
| "Read more about costs here." | "The BAR 2024 industry report shows costs rose 15%." |
| "According to this study..." | "Research from Which? (2024) found that 67% of customers..." |
| "Source" | "ONS household expenditure data" |

### Quantity & Context Requirements

External links increase page authority when used correctly. Zero external links = E-E-A-T red flag.

**Link Density:**
- Ratio: ~1 external link per 300-500 words
- Minimum: 3 per article (1 citation + 1 authority + 1 reputation)
- Maximum: Don't exceed internal link count

**Context Requirement:** Every external link must be preceded or followed by an explanatory sentence establishing source credibility.

**Example:**
```markdown
❌ Bad (no context):
"The average cost is £1,200 ([source](https://...))."

✅ Good (with context):
"According to the UK's leading consumer research organization, 
the [Which? 2024 Home Services Survey](https://which.co.uk/...) 
found the average cost is £1,200 — a 12% increase from 2023."
```

### Requirements by Intent

| Intent | Min. Links | Required Types |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| informational | 3 | 1 citation, 1 authority, 1 any |
| commercial | 3 | 1 citation, 1 authority, 1 reputation |
| comparison | 4 | 2 citations, 1 authority, 1 reputation |
| transactional | 2 | 1 authority (regulations), 1 reputation |

### Integration with Schema (Automatic)

`reputation` type links should auto-populate the Author's `sameAs` field in JSON-LD:

```json
{
  "@type": "Person",
  "name": "John Smith",
  "sameAs": [
    "https://linkedin.com/in/john-smith",      // reputation link
    "https://industry-body.org/member/12345"   // reputation link
  ]
}
```

### Frontmatter Tracking (Optional)

For audit purposes, track external link types:

```yaml
externalLinks:
  citations: 2
  authority: 1
  reputation: 1
  affiliate: 0
```

## Semantic Keywords (LSI) Without Stuffing

Modern SEO requires **topic coverage**, not keyword repetition. Google understands synonyms and related concepts.

### What Are Semantic Keywords?

Semantic keywords (Latent Semantic Indexing) are terms and phrases naturally related to your primary keyword. They signal comprehensive topic coverage without keyword stuffing.

### How to Find Semantic Keywords

**Google "People Also Ask":**
- Questions reveal related concepts users search for
- Each PAA expansion shows semantic relationships

**Google autocomplete:**
- Type primary keyword + "how", "what", "why"
- Suggestions show common semantic variations

**Top-ranking competitors:**
- What terminology do they use?
- What subtopics do they cover?

**Industry terminology:**
- Technical terms experts use
- Process steps and stages
- Equipment/tool names
- Regulatory/certification terms

### Integration Strategy

**DON'T:** Force exact-match keywords unnaturally

❌ **Bad (keyword stuffing):**
```markdown
Solar panel installation is important. When choosing solar panel installation,
consider solar panel installation costs. Our solar panel installation service
offers solar panel installation quotes.
```

**DO:** Use semantic keywords naturally in context

✅ **Good (semantic coverage):**
```markdown
Installing photovoltaic systems requires careful planning. When choosing renewable
energy solutions, consider equipment costs, labor rates, and grid-tied inverter
specifications. Our service offers detailed quotes covering mounting hardware,
electrical work, and MCS certification.
```
(Uses: photovoltaic systems, renewable energy, grid-tied, mounting hardware, MCS certification - all semantically related without repeating "solar panel installation")

### Example: "Solar Panel Installation"

**Related terms to include naturally:**

**Process terms:**
- Mounting, wiring, commissioning
- Inverter installation, grid connection
- Scaffolding setup, roof survey
- System sizing, load calculation

**Product/equipment:**
- Photovoltaic panels, monocrystalline modules
- String inverters, micro-inverters, optimizers
- Mounting rails, flashings, conduit
- Consumer unit, generation meter

**Specifications:**
- kWp capacity, efficiency rating
- Panel degradation, performance warranty
- System voltage, array configuration

**Commercial terms:**
- Installation quotes, project costs
- ROI calculations, payback period
- Smart Export Guarantee, feed-in tariff
- Energy bill savings, generation income

**Regulatory:**
- MCS certification, building regulations
- Permitted development, planning permission
- DNO notification, G99 application
- Electrical safety compliance

### By Intent Type

**Informational intent** ("how to choose solar panels"):
- Selection criteria, comparison factors
- Technology types, efficiency metrics
- Performance testing, warranty terms
- Expert recommendations, buyer's guide

**Commercial intent** ("solar panel cost"):
- Pricing breakdown, quote components
- Budget considerations, financing options
- Cost factors, price drivers
- Value comparison, ROI analysis

**Comparison intent** ("monocrystalline vs polycrystalline"):
- Performance differences, efficiency gap
- Cost trade-offs, warranty comparison
- Suitability factors, application scenarios
- Long-term value, degradation rates

**Transactional intent** ("book solar installation"):
- Service availability, appointment booking
- Installation timeline, project scheduling
- Quote process, survey requirements
- Deposit terms, payment options

### Coverage Rules

- **Variety:** Don't repeat same phrase - use semantic alternatives
- **Natural:** Trust Google understands synonyms and related concepts
- **Depth:** Cover subtopics thoroughly rather than keyword density
- **Context:** Related terms should fit naturally in sentences

### Testing Semantic Coverage

**Ask yourself:**
1. Have I covered all major subtopics of this keyword?
2. Am I using industry-standard terminology where appropriate?
3. Would an expert recognize comprehensive coverage?
4. Have I explained processes/concepts fully without repetition?

**Good semantic coverage = comprehensive topic authority without keyword stuffing.**

## Skyscraper Technique (Backlink Acquisition Strategy)

The Skyscraper Technique (Brian Dean/Backlinko method) creates content SO comprehensive that sites linking to competitor articles willingly switch their links to yours.

### The 3-Step Process

#### Step 1: Find Link-Worthy Content in Your Niche

**Goal:** Identify existing content that has attracted many backlinks but is outdated or incomplete.

**Tools to use:**
- Ahrefs (Content Explorer → filter by referring domains >50)
- SEMrush (Backlink Analytics → find competitors' best pages)
- Google Search (`allintitle:"your topic"` → check backlinks of top results)

**What to look for:**

| Criteria | Target | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| Referring domains | 50+ | Enough backlinks to justify effort |
| Publication date | 2+ years old | Content likely outdated |
| Content depth | 1000-2000 words | Room for 10x improvement |
| Topic relevance | Exact niche match | Your audience = their audience |
| Author activity | Abandoned/inactive | Less likely to update |

**Example audit:**

```bash
Target article: "Complete Guide to Solar Panel Costs" (2020)
- Referring domains: 127
- Word count: 1,500 words
- Last updated: 2020
- Missing: 2026 pricing, new regulations, recent tech advances
- Opportunity: Create definitive 2026 version
```

#### Step 2: Create Something 10x Better

**"10x better" means:**

- **More comprehensive:** Cover everything they covered + gaps they missed
- **More current:** Latest data, regulations, pricing (2026 vs outdated 2020)
- **Better formatted:** Superior layout, visuals, readability
- **Original data:** Add case studies, surveys, expert quotes they lack
- **Better visuals:** Custom graphics, charts, screenshots vs generic stock photos

**Skyscraper content checklist:**

✅ **Depth improvements:**
- [ ] 2-3x longer (if 1500 words, create 3000-5000 words)
- [ ] Cover all subtopics they mention + 3-5 they missed
- [ ] Add sections addressing recent developments
- [ ] Include step-by-step processes (not just theory)

✅ **Currency improvements:**
- [ ] All statistics from last 12 months
- [ ] Current year in title ("2026 Guide")
- [ ] Recent examples and case studies
- [ ] Updated regulations/laws mentioned
- [ ] "Last updated: [Month Year]" banner

✅ **Original data:**
- [ ] Your own research/survey results
- [ ] Client case studies with real numbers
- [ ] Expert interviews (named sources)
- [ ] Testing results ("We tested 5 panels...")
- [ ] Original framework or methodology

✅ **Visual improvements:**
- [ ] Custom infographics (not stock images)
- [ ] Data visualizations (charts/graphs)
- [ ] Comparison tables
- [ ] Process diagrams/flowcharts
- [ ] Video content embedded

✅ **User experience:**
- [ ] Table of contents with jump links
- [ ] Mobile-optimized layout
- [ ] Faster page load (<2s LCP)
- [ ] Interactive elements (calculators, tools)
- [ ] Downloadable resources (PDFs, templates)

**Example transformation:**

| Aspect | Original Article | Your Skyscraper |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| Title | "Solar Panel Costs Guide" | "Solar Panel Installation Costs UK: Complete 2026 Guide (500+ Real Projects)" |
| Word count | 1,500 words | 4,200 words |
| Data source | Generic industry stats | Custom survey of 500 UK installations |
| Visuals | 3 stock photos | 12 custom graphics + 2 videos + calculator |
| Depth | Surface-level | Step-by-step process with regional pricing breakdown |
| Currency | 2020 data | January 2026 data + quarterly update schedule |

#### Step 3: Strategic Outreach to Link Prospects

**Goal:** Get sites linking to the old article to link to (or switch to) your superior version.

**Identifying link prospects:**

```bash
# Using Ahrefs/SEMrush
1. Find all sites linking to competitor article
2. Filter by:
   - Domain Authority > 30 (quality sites)
   - DoFollow links only (SEO value)
   - Active sites (published in last year)
   - Relevant context (link from relevant content)
3. Export list (~100-200 prospects)
```

**Outreach email templates:**

**Template 1: New Resource (for existing linkers)**

```
Subject: [Article Topic] resource updated for 2026

Hi [Name],

I noticed you linked to [Competitor Article Title] in your article "[Their Article]".

Great resource, but it's from 2020 and several things have changed:

If you're updating your article, you might find it useful for your readers.

Either way, keep up the great work on [Their Site]!

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Template 2: Resource Gap (for sites that should link but don't)**

```
Subject: Resource for "[Their Article Title]"

Hi [Name],

Your article "[Their Article]" is really comprehensive. I especially liked [specific detail you genuinely liked].

I noticed you covered [Topic A] and [Topic B], but didn't link to any resources on [Specific Gap].

I've just published a detailed guide on exactly that:
[Your Article URL]

Includes:
- [Unique Data Point]
- [Original Research/Case Study]
- [Practical Tool/Resource]

Thought your readers might find it helpful as a companion resource.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Outreach best practices:**

✅ **Do:**
- Personalize every email (mention specific detail from their article)
- Explain WHY your content is better (newer data, more comprehensive)
- Make it easy (provide exact URL, suggest specific paragraph for link)
- Follow up once after 7 days (polite reminder)
- Track responses in spreadsheet

❌ **Don't:**
- Send generic templates (gets ignored/spam)
- Demand or expect links (relationship first)
- Oversell ("the best guide ever!")
- Spam multiple contacts at same site
- Follow up more than twice

**Outreach tracking:**

```markdown
| Site | Contact | Email Sent | Response | Link Added | DA |
|------|---------|-----------|----------|-----------|-----|
| example.com | John | 2026-01-15 | Positive | Yes | 65 |
| another.com | Sarah | 2026-01-15 | No reply | - | 52 |
| blog.com | Mike | 2026-01-16 | Declined | No | 48 |
```

**Expected conversion rates:**
- **Response rate:** 20-30% (of outreach emails)
- **Link acquisition:** 5-15% (of total outreach)
- **High-authority links:** 2-5% (DA 60+)

### Skyscraper Technique Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Tasks |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Research | 1-2 weeks | Find link-worthy content, analyze backlink profiles |
| Creation | 2-4 weeks | Write 10x content, create visuals, test tools |
| Outreach | 4-8 weeks | Contact prospects, follow-ups, relationship building |
| Results | 2-6 months | Links gradually appear, rankings improve |

**Total time investment:** 2-3 months from start to measurable results

### When to Use Skyscraper Technique

✅ **Best for:**
- Competitive niches where rankings are difficult
- Topics with existing high-authority content (backlink potential)
- Pillar content pieces (justify the time investment)
- Evergreen topics that won't quickly become outdated
- When you have unique data/insights to add

❌ **Skip for:**
- Brand new topics with no existing content
- News/time-sensitive content (outdates too quickly)
- Niche topics with <10 existing articles
- When you lack resources for 10x content
- Local service pages (different link building strategy)

### Skyscraper vs. Standard Content

| Aspect | Standard Content | Skyscraper Content |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Goal** | Rank for keywords | Acquire high-quality backlinks + rank |
| **Depth** | 1000-1500 words | 3000-5000+ words |
| **Research time** | 2-4 hours | 10-20 hours |
| **Writing time** | 4-6 hours | 15-30 hours |
| **Visuals** | 3-5 images | 10+ custom graphics/videos |
| **Outreach** | None | 100-200 personalized emails |
| **Timeline** | Publish and done | 2-3 month campaign |
| **Link velocity** | 0-3 links/year | 10-30+ links in 6 months |
| **Best use** | Regular blog posts | Pillar content, definitive guides |

- [ ] Re-promote to new link prospects

**Annual refresh:**
- Rewrite sections that became outdated
- Add new sections for emerging topics
- Update title year (2026 → 2027)
- Repeat outreach to new sites that linked to competitors

**Content decay warning:** Without updates, Skyscraper content loses its "10x" advantage within 12-18 months.

## SERP Feature Targeting (Position 0 Strategy)

Beyond ranking #1, target **SERP features** (Position 0, Knowledge Panels, People Also Ask, Video Carousels, Image Packs) to dominate search visibility.

### Types of SERP Features & Optimization

#### 1. Featured Snippets (Position 0)

**What they are:** Boxed answer appearing above organic results (drives 8-12% CTR)

**How to optimize:**

- **Paragraph snippets:** 40-60 word direct answer immediately after H2
  ```markdown
  ## How much does solar installation cost?

  Solar installation costs £6,200-£8,500 for a typical UK home. This includes panels, inverter, labor, and MCS certification. System size (3-4kW average) and roof complexity affect the final price.
  ```

- **List snippets:** 5-8 items with parallel structure
  ```markdown
  ## How to choose a solar installer

  1. **Verify MCS certification** — Required for warranties and incentives

## FAQ: Common Solar Installation Questions

### How long does solar installation take?

Most solar installations complete in 1-2 days for residential properties. The actual panel mounting and electrical work takes 6-8 hours, but you'll need scaffolding set up the day before. Planning and permitting beforehand takes 4-6 weeks.

### Do I need planning permission for solar panels?

Solar panels are permitted development in most UK homes, meaning no planning permission needed. Exceptions include listed buildings, conservation areas, and panels extending more than 200mm from the roof slope.
