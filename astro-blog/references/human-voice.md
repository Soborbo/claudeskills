# Human Voice Guidelines

**Priority:** Sound human FIRST, optimize for search SECOND.

---

## The AI Detection Problem

AI-generated content has telltale patterns:
- Robotic answer-first EVERY paragraph
- Components breaking up every 300 words
- Identical sentence structures
- Backwards phrasing for "entity salience"
- Template-like predictability

**Your goal:** Write like an expert human, not a content-generation machine.

---

## The Human Test (Critical)

Before marking content complete, read it aloud and ask:

1. **Voice:** Would a human expert write it this way?
2. **Variety:** Can you read 3 paragraphs without seeing a pattern?
3. **Flow:** Do transitions feel natural or forced?
4. **Pacing:** Are components enhancing or interrupting?
5. **Authenticity:** Does it sound like a person or a template?

**If it screams "AI wrote this," rewrite with more variety.**

---

## Component Density Limits

### Maximum Allowed (1000-1500 word article)

```
Required:
- QueryAnswer: 1 (must have)
- TL;DR: 1 (if >1000 words)

Sparingly:
- ExpertInsight: 1-2 MAX (not one per H2!)
- EngagementHook: 0-2 MAX (only if natural)
- ExperienceBlock: 1 (required for commercial/comparison)
- CTAs: 2 (intro, end)

Total component breaks: 5-7 in entire article
```

### Maximum Allowed (2500+ word pillar)

```
- QueryAnswer: 1
- TL;DR: 1
- ExpertInsight: 2-3 MAX
- EngagementHook: 2-4 MAX
- ExperienceBlock: 1-2
- CTAs: 3-4

Total component breaks: 8-12 in entire article
```

**Philosophy:** Components are seasoning, not the meal. Most content should be clean, flowing prose.

---

## Paragraph Structure Variety

### DON'T: Answer-first Every Time

❌ **Robotic pattern:**
```
Solar panels cost £5,000-£8,000 in the UK. This price includes installation and equipment.

Installation takes 1-2 days typically. The process involves mounting and wiring.

Maintenance requires annual inspections. These checks ensure optimal performance.
```

Every paragraph starts with the answer. Reads like a FAQ robot.

---

### DO: Mix Answer-First with Storytelling

✅ **Human variety:**

**Answer-first (use for):**
- QueryAnswer section
- Direct cost/time questions
- After H2s asking "how much" or "how long"

**Narrative/build-up (use for):**
- Personal stories and case studies
- Problem → solution flow
- Engaging section openings
- Cautionary tales

**Example with variety:**

```markdown
Last month, a client called us in a panic. She'd received three quotes
for the same solar installation: £2,000, £4,500, and £6,500. How could
there be such a gap?

The answer comes down to what's actually included. A typical residential
solar installation costs £5,000-£8,000 in the UK, but that wide range
reflects major differences in scope.

Here's what separates a £5,000 quote from a £8,000 one. The cheaper
option might skip the battery backup (saving £2,000) or use lower-efficiency
panels (saving another £800). You're not comparing apples to apples.

In our experience across 200+ installations, clients who chose the cheapest
quote ended up spending 15-20% more within two years on upgrades they should
have included initially.
```

**Notice:** Only paragraph 2 is pure answer-first. Others build, narrate, or caution.

---

## Entity Salience - Balanced Approach

### Current rigid rule creates unnatural writing

❌ **Forced backwards phrasing:**
- "Python's speed attracts developers" (to make Python the subject)
- "Solar panels' cost concerns homeowners" (unnatural)
- "Installation's timeline affects planning" (awkward)

### New balanced rule

**REQUIRED:**
- First paragraph: main entity prominent (as subject OR object)
- First sentence after H2: entity present and clear

**ALLOWED natural phrasing:**
- "Many homeowners choose solar for long-term savings" ✅
- "Our clients typically see ROI in 5-7 years" ✅
- "When you're comparing quotes, look for..." ✅
- "Most installations complete in 1-2 days" ✅

**Key insight:** Entity density (mentioning it regularly) matters more than rigid subject-position in every sentence.

---

## Forbidden Phrases - Revised

### Previously banned transitions

The old rule banned:
- "Many people..."
- "It's important to note..."
- "When it comes to..."
- "Let's explore..."

### New nuanced approach

**ALLOWED sparingly:**
- "Many homeowners ask about..." ✅ (transitioning to FAQ)
- "It's worth noting that..." ✅ (important caveats)
- "When choosing a provider..." ✅ (natural advice)
- "Here's what matters..." ✅ (emphasis)

**STILL FORBIDDEN:**
- Starting 3+ paragraphs with the same phrase
- Using them as filler when you don't know what to say
- "Let's dive into..." or "Let's explore..." (too blog-coach)
- "In today's world..." or "In this day and age..." (cliché)

**Guideline:** Use natural speech. Vary transitions. Sound like a human expert talking.

---

## H2 Headings - Flexible Guidelines

### SEO-optimized questions are PREFERRED

✅ **Best (rank better):**
- "How Much Does Solar Installation Cost in 2025?"
- "What's Included in a Typical Quote?"
- "When Is the Best Time to Install Solar Panels?"

### Contextual headings are ALLOWED

✅ **Acceptable when natural:**
- "Understanding Your Options" (if followed by clear breakdown)
- "Why This Matters for Your Home" (decision context)
- "Our Approach to Pricing Transparency" (methodology)
- "The Hidden Costs Nobody Mentions" (intriguing)

### Generic headings are STILL FORBIDDEN

❌ **Never use:**
- "Introduction" (readers know it's the intro)
- "Overview" (too vague)
- "More Information" (meaningless)
- "Details" (what details?)
- "Things to Know" (what things?)

**Test:** Can someone scan just H2s and understand the article structure? If yes, it works.

---

## Experience - Woven In, Not Boxed

### DON'T: ExperienceBlock component every time

❌ **Over-componentized:**
```markdown
## What Affects Installation Time?

[300 words of explanation]

<ExperienceBlock type="data">
In our 200+ installations, average time was 1.2 days.
</ExperienceBlock>
```

Result: Feels template-like. Experience is in a box, separate from narrative.

---

### DO: Weave experience into prose naturally

✅ **Natural integration:**

```markdown
## What Affects Installation Time?

Most installations complete in 1-2 days, but we've learned from 200+ projects
that roof complexity is the wild card. Last quarter, our average was 1.2 days,
but Victorian terraces with slate roofs averaged 2.8 days.

The installers need clear access to your roof, your fuse box, and ideally
an outdoor wall for the inverter. When we worked with the Johnsons in
Islington, we lost half a day just navigating scaffolding around their
extension. Factor that in if your access is tricky.

[Continue with natural flow...]
```

**Experience is in the writing itself, not a component box.**

---

### RESERVE ExperienceBlock component for:

- Detailed case studies with line-item costs
- Before/after data in table format
- Screenshots or visual proof
- Significant proprietary research

**Not for:** Every mention of "we've found" or "our clients."

---

## Pacing & Rhythm

### Good articles have variety

**Fast sections:**
- Answer-first paragraphs
- Bulleted lists
- Comparison tables
- Quick cost breakdowns

**Slow sections:**
- Storytelling and case studies
- Detailed explanations
- Problem → solution narratives
- Cautionary tales

**Breathing room:**
- Clean prose without components
- 3-4 paragraphs of uninterrupted flow
- Conversational tone

**Emphasis:**
- Strategic use of components
- Pull quotes from experts
- Key statistics highlighted

### NOT this pattern:

```
[Component]
[300 words prose]
[Component]
[300 words prose]
[Component]
[300 words prose]
```

Result: Predictable. Robotic. Template-like.

---

## Natural Dialogue & Questions

### Use rhetorical questions sparingly

✅ **Good (creates engagement):**
- "Why the wide price range?" (transitions to explanation)
- "What's the catch?" (addresses skepticism)
- "Is it worth it?" (reader's actual question)

❌ **Bad (feels artificial):**
- "Have you ever wondered about solar costs?" (patronizing)
- "What if I told you..." (clickbait)
- "Did you know that..." (every 300 words becomes pattern)

---

### Use conversational asides

✅ **Natural expert voice:**
- "Here's the thing nobody tells you..."
- "In 15 years, I've never seen..."
- "The industry won't admit this, but..."
- "Most installers skip this step—big mistake."

These sound like a human expert talking, not a content brief.

---

## Statistic Presentation

### DON'T: Isolate every stat

❌ **Over-formatted:**
```markdown
**Key statistic:**
- **73% of customers** underestimate costs by **20-30%**
```

Result: Reads like a PowerPoint, not an article.

---

### DO: Mix isolated stats with inline stats

✅ **Variety:**

**Inline (most of the time):**
"According to Which?'s 2024 survey, 73% of customers underestimate project
costs by 20-30%—usually because they forget about scaffolding and electrical
upgrades."

**Isolated (for emphasis, max 2-3 per article):**
```markdown
**Critical finding from our 2024 data:**
- 73% underestimate costs by 20-30%
- Peak season (May-August) adds 15% premium
- London installations cost 30% more than national average
```

Reserve formatting for genuinely important stats, not every number.

---

## Tables - Strategic Use

### DON'T: Table for every comparison

The old rule: "For ANY comparison (X vs Y), include a table."

Result: 5-6 tables in one article. Feels like a spec sheet.

---

### DO: Tables for complex multi-factor comparisons

✅ **Use tables when:**
- Comparing 3+ options across 4+ factors
- Showing pricing tiers or packages
- Data that's genuinely hard to parse in prose

✅ **Use prose when:**
- Comparing 2 options with 1-2 differences
- Building narrative around trade-offs
- Explaining nuanced decisions

**Example (prose better than table):**

```markdown
DIY installation saves £1,500-£2,000 but takes 2-3 days of your time and
carries all the risk if something fails. Professional installation costs
more upfront but includes insurance, warranty, and—crucially—you're not
the one on the roof in February.
```

No table needed. Natural comparison.

---

## Opening Hooks

### Avoid formulaic openings

❌ **AI-like patterns:**
- "In 2025, solar panel costs have become a common question..."
- "When it comes to solar installation, many homeowners wonder..."
- "Are you considering solar panels for your home?"

### Use human hooks

✅ **Engaging openings:**

**Start with a story:**
"Three different quotes. Three wildly different prices. All for the same roof."

**Start with surprising stat:**
"The cheapest solar quote costs you more. Here's why."

**Start with the answer:**
"A typical UK home pays £5,000-£8,000 for solar installation, but 30%
overpay because they don't know these three factors."

**Start with common mistake:**
"Most homeowners focus on panel cost and ignore installation—then wonder
why the final bill is £2,000 higher."

Vary your openings. Sound human.

---

## Editing for Human Voice

### After writing, apply these fixes:

1. **Pattern detection:** Read 5 consecutive paragraphs. Do they all start the same way? Vary them.

2. **Component density:** Count the boxes. More than 7 in a 1500-word article? Remove some.

3. **Read aloud:** Does it sound like a person talking or a template filling in?

4. **Transition variety:** Highlight the first 3 words of each paragraph. Repeating? Change them.

5. **Entity rigidity:** Find sentences with backwards phrasing. Can you make them more natural without losing the entity?

6. **Experience weaving:** Find ExperienceBlock components. Can you integrate that info into prose instead?

---

## The 80/20 Rule

- **80% clean, flowing prose** - Natural sentences, varied structure, conversational
- **20% components & formatting** - Strategic emphasis, genuine data, breaks

Not 50/50. Not component-heavy.

## Intentional Imperfection: Human Typos

AI writes with perfect spelling and grammar. Humans don't. Strategic, subtle imperfections make content feel authentic.

### Types of Human Typos to Include

**Homophone Confusion** (use sparingly, 1-2 per article):
- "Your going to want..." (should be "You're")
- "It's important to check there credentials" (should be "their")
- "This effects your decision" (should be "affects")
- "The costs vary depending on the weather" (could be "whether" in context)

**Common Misspellings** (that spell-check might miss):
- "definately" (definitely)
- "seperate" (separate)
- "occured" (occurred)
- "accomodate" (accommodate)
- "recieve" (receive)
- "untill" (until)
- "loosing" (losing - when you mean "losing ground")

**Transposed Letters** (realistic finger-slip typos):
- "hte" (the) - only in casual contexts
- "wierd" (weird)
- "freind" (friend)
- "thier" (their)

**Then/Than Confusion**:
- "More expensive then you'd think" (should be "than")
- "First X, than Y" (should be "then")

**Missing Apostrophes** (in casual/conversational sections):
- "dont" (don't)
- "wont" (won't)
- "cant" (can't)

### Where to Place Typos

**ACCEPTABLE locations:**
- Conversational asides
- Casual quotes or anecdotes
- Bullet points with informal tone
- ExpertInsight components (sounds more off-the-cuff)

**NEVER in:**
- QueryAnswer block (first impression matters)
- Headings (H1, H2, H3)
- CTAs (conversion-critical)
- Statistics or data (credibility)
- External link anchor text (SEO + credibility)
- Schema markup or frontmatter

### Guidelines for Realistic Imperfection

1. **Frequency:** 1-3 subtle typos per 1500-word article
2. **Type variety:** Mix homophone errors with common misspellings
3. **Context matters:** Use in sections that sound conversational
4. **Don't overdo it:** Too many typos = careless, not human
5. **Spell-check resistant:** Choose typos that pass basic spell-check

### Example: Before and After

❌ **Too perfect (AI-like):**
```markdown
You're going to want to check their credentials before committing.
It's definitely worth the effort to separate the good providers from
the bad. This affects your decision more than you'd think.
```

✅ **Realistic (human-like):**
```markdown
Your going to want to check their credentials before committing.
It's definately worth the effort to seperate the good providers from
the bad. This effects your decision more then you'd think.
```

**Note:** Only 2-3 typos, strategically placed. Not every sentence.

### Why This Works

- **AI detection tools** flag perfect grammar as machine-generated
- **Readers subconsciously** recognize human imperfection as authentic
- **Search engines** don't penalize minor typos in body content
- **Context wins:** A well-researched article with 1-2 typos feels more real than perfect prose

### Important Caveats

⚠️ **Don't use if:**
- Client specifically requests error-free content
- YMYL/medical/legal content (typos reduce trust)
- Academic or highly technical content
- Content will be translated (typos confuse translators)

⚠️ **Use with judgment:**
- B2C lead-gen content: Yes (conversational)
- B2B enterprise content: No (professionalism matters)
- Blog posts: Yes (casual, expert voice)
- Landing pages: Maybe (only in testimonials/quotes)

---

## Final Check: The Turing Test

**Would a reader know this was AI-written?**

If the answer is "probably yes" because:
- Components every 300 words
- Every paragraph starts the same
- No personality or voice
- Feels template-like
- **Perfect spelling and grammar** (too polished)

...then rewrite with more humanity.

**Remember:** You're an expert sharing knowledge, not a content generation script filling a template.
