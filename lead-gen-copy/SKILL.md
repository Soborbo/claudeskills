# Lead Gen Copy Skill

Conversion-focused copywriting for service business websites. No brand manifesto, no content strategy — pure lead generation copy.

## Core Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Problem first, solution second** — MUST lead with pain, then relief
2. **Benefit over feature** — MUST state outcome, not capability
3. **Specific over vague** — "47 seconds" not "quick", "4.98★" not "high rated"
4. **One CTA per viewport** — MUST NOT compete with yourself
5. **You > We** — MUST talk about them, not yourself
6. **Active voice only** — "We move your furniture" not "Your furniture is moved"
7. **Reading level: Year 8** — MUST use simple words, short sentences
8. **Every claim needs proof** — No proof = FAIL

## CRO Page Order (Mandatory)

Sections MUST follow this conversion logic:

1. **Hero** — Outcome-driven promise + primary CTA
2. **Proof** — Trust signals, ratings, logos (immediate credibility)
3. **Problem** — Empathy, agitation (they feel understood)
4. **Solution** — How you solve it (relief)
5. **Benefits** — What they get (desire)
6. **Objection handling** — FAQ, guarantees (remove friction)
7. **Final CTA** — Urgency + reassurance (action)

Deviation from this order MUST be justified.

## Forbidden (STOP)

STOP and fix if any of these occur:

### Language
- ❌ Passive voice in CTAs
- ❌ Corporate jargon ("leverage", "synergy", "solutions", "utilize")
- ❌ Buzzwords: "innovative", "best-in-class", "leading", "cutting-edge", "world-class"
- ❌ Vague superlatives without proof ("best", "top", "leading")
- ❌ Questions as headlines without immediate answer
- ❌ "Click here", "Submit", "Send" as CTA text

### Structure
- ❌ Multiple CTAs competing in same viewport
- ❌ Wall of text over 80 words without break
- ❌ Feature-only copy (no benefit stated)
- ❌ Claim without proof (numbers, testimonial, or credential)

### Quality
- ❌ Negative framing without resolution
- ❌ Lorem ipsum or placeholder text in deliverable
- ❌ Form without microcopy (privacy, effort, error states)

## Headline Formula

**Structure:** [Outcome] + [Timeframe/Ease] + [Without Pain Point]

**Examples:**
- "Get Your Free Quote in 47 Seconds"
- "Move House Without the Stress"
- "Save £200 on Your Next Move"

**H1 must contain:**
- Primary service/outcome
- Location (if local business)
- Differentiator or proof point

## CTA Text Rules

| Context | Pattern | Examples |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Primary CTA | Action + Benefit | "Get Free Quote", "Book Your Move" |
| Soft CTA | Lower commitment | "See Pricing", "How It Works" |
| Phone CTA | Urgency + Human | "Speak to Jay Now", "Call for Same-Day Quote" |
| WhatsApp | Casual + Fast | "Message Us", "Quick Question?" |

**Power words for CTAs:** Free, Instant, Now, Today, Your, My, Get, Start

## Tone of Voice

| Tone | When | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| Empathetic | Problem section | "We know moving is stressful" |
| Confident | Solution section | "That's exactly why we exist" |
| Reassuring | Trust section | "Your belongings are safe with us" |
| Urgent | CTA section | "Limited slots this week" |

**Voice consistency:**
- Professional but warm (not corporate)
- Direct but not pushy
- Confident but not arrogant
- Like a trusted friend who's an expert

## Section-Specific Copy

| Section | Focus | Word Count |
|---------|-------|------------|
| Hero | One clear promise + CTA | 20-40 words |
| USP Strip | 3-4 proof points | 5-8 words each |
| Problem | Empathy + agitation | 40-80 words |
| Solution | Relief + capability | 40-80 words |
| Benefits | Outcome per benefit | 15-25 words each |
| Social Proof | Real quotes, specific | Verbatim |
| FAQ | Clear answers, no fluff | 30-60 words each |
| Final CTA | Urgency + reassurance | 20-40 words |
