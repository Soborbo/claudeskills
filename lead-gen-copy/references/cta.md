# CTA Text Patterns

## Primary CTA (High Commitment)

### Quote/Estimate
| Text | Notes |
|------|-------|
| "Get Free Quote" | Standard, works everywhere |
| "Get My Free Quote" | Personal touch, +5-10% CTR |
| "Get Instant Quote" | If calculator provides immediate result |
| "See My Price" | Lower friction than "quote" |

### Booking
| Text | Notes |
|------|-------|
| "Book Now" | Direct, works for known services |
| "Book Your [Service]" | More specific |
| "Reserve My Spot" | Adds scarcity feel |
| "Schedule Free Consultation" | For high-value services |

### Contact
| Text | Notes |
|------|-------|
| "Get in Touch" | Soft, professional |
| "Talk to an Expert" | Positions quality |
| "Start the Conversation" | Very soft |

## Secondary CTA (Low Commitment)

| Text | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| "See Pricing" | When prices aren't hidden |
| "View Services" | Service overview page |
| "How It Works" | Process explanation |
| "See Our Work" | Portfolio/gallery |
| "Learn More" | Generic fallback (avoid if possible) |

## Phone CTA

| Text | Notes |
|------|-------|
| "Call Now" | Direct, urgent |
| "Speak to [Name]" | Personal, if owner-operated |
| "Call for Same-Day Quote" | Urgency + benefit |
| "Prefer to Talk? Call Us" | Offers alternative |

## WhatsApp CTA

| Text | Notes |
|------|-------|
| "Message Us" | Simple, direct |
| "WhatsApp Us" | Clear channel |
| "Quick Question? Message Us" | Lowers barrier |
| "Chat on WhatsApp" | Casual |

## Button vs Link

**Use Button when:**
- Primary conversion action
- Above the fold
- Quote request, booking, call

**Use Link when:**
- Secondary action
- Navigation-style
- "Learn more", "See pricing"

## CTA Microcopy

Add reassurance below/near CTA:

| CTA | Microcopy |
|-----|-----------|
| "Get Free Quote" | "No obligation. Takes 60 seconds." |
| "Book Now" | "Free cancellation up to 24 hours before." |
| "Call Now" | "We answer in under 30 seconds." |
| "Submit" (form) | "We'll respond within 2 hours." |

## A/B Test Winners (Industry Data)

### Removals/Moving
1. "Get Free Quote" (baseline)
2. "Get My Free Quote" (+8%)
3. "See My Moving Price" (+12% for calculators)

### Home Services
1. "Book Now" (baseline)
2. "Book Your [Service] Today" (+6%)
3. "Get Started" (-4%, too vague)

### B2B/Professional
1. "Schedule a Call" (baseline)
2. "Book Free Consultation" (+15%)
3. "Talk to an Expert" (+10%)

## Never Use

- ❌ "Submit" — Zero benefit communicated
- ❌ "Click Here" — Obvious and meaningless
- ❌ "Send" — Weak, passive
- ❌ "Register" — Sounds like commitment
- ❌ "Download Now" — For lead magnets only
- ❌ "Buy Now" — Lead gen isn't e-commerce

## Mobile-Specific

Shorter is better on mobile:
- Desktop: "Get Your Free Quote Today"
- Mobile: "Get Quote"

Sticky mobile bar CTAs should be ultra-short:
- "Call" (with phone icon)
- "Quote" or "WhatsApp"
