## Hungarian Specifics

Hungarian copy tends to be:
- More formal (use "Ön" not "te" for business)
- Direct (less hedging than English)
- Emphatic (stronger claims accepted)

**Example Hungarian tone:**
> "Garantáltan a legalacsonyabb ár, vagy visszafizetjük a különbséget!"
> (Guaranteed lowest price, or we refund the difference!)
